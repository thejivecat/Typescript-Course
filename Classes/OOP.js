//What's OOP?
//Work with (real-life) Entities in your code
//e.g. for an online shop
//you may have a ProductList object
//renders a list of products which were fetched from a server(db)
//objects holds rendering + fetching logic
//you may have a product object
//renders details about a product and allows addition to a cat
//object hold rendering + cart-adding logic
//these two objects may be related
//you may have a shoppingCart object
//renders cart products and total and allows user to order them
//object holds rendering + ordering (server communication logic)
//Classes and Instances
//Objects
//the things you work with in code
//class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals
//Classes
//blueprints for objects
//an object can be an instance of a class (has same properties and methods)
//define how objects look like, which props and methods they have
